**Boston, December 28, 2016** -- Aquent Gymnasium is pleased to roll out the new and improved [**Introducing Sketch for UX and UI**](http://bit.ly/GYM_SketchNew) Gym Short, with updates to reflect the many new features that Sketch has made since our initial course release in November 2015.

The new course has a set of 11 videos covering everything from workspace basics to exporting graphical assets, taught by Gymnasium Academic Director Jeremy Osborn.  

In addition to the technical aspects of Sketch, this short course covers a number of best practices related to UX and UI prototyping, such as how to name and organize assets, how to supercharge workflow with Sketch plugins, and how to add interactivity using InVision.

Like all of our other Gym Shorts, [**Introducing Sketch for UX and UI**](http://bit.ly/GYM_SketchNew)
remains a short course designed to be completed quickly and students can always skip to the chapters they want if they’re really pressed for time. 

Finally, like everything else on Gymnasium, this high-quality course is completely free. Learn more by visiting the [Gymnasium course page](http://bit.ly/GYM_SketchNew).
