JavaScript first appeared over twenty years ago, and since then it has become one of the most important languages on and off the web. Today’s JavaScript ecosystem, driven by sophisticated technologies, frameworks, and libraries, brings a new level of interaction and innovation to the web that exceeds the humble beginnings of the early days of JavaScript. Both Kevin and Keith provide an in-the-trenches perspective to navigating the JavaScript landscape.
