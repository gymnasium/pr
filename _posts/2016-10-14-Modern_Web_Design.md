**Boston, October 14, 2016** — Aquent Gymnasium is pleased to announce the launch of [Modern Web Design](http://bit.ly/GYM_MWD), a full-length course taught by Web Standards expert Aaron Gustafson. The course is free and available online 24/7.

Modern Web Design is perfect for designers, aspiring front-end developers, and other creatives who want to expand their skills and take their career to a new level. In six hours of instruction, students will learn how to mark up content with semantic HTML, use CSS as a design tool, and add interactivity to web pages with JavaScript.

Beyond the basics, you will also learn how to build a responsive website that works seamlessly on all devices and platforms. Upon completion of this course, you will have built a multi-page responsive website that utilizes all of your new skills.

The only prerequisites for this course are familiarity with the web and experience with a text editor such as Sublime Text, Atom, BBEdit, etc.

Instructor Aaron Gustafson said, “I know you’ll love this course. It could even transform your career!”
